# PWC-POWER-BI-INTERNSHIP
I am happy to share that I have completed my PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Case Experience offered by Forage. It was a great learning experience as I got to work on real time datasets.With completion of each task I have learnt something new.

As a part of this internship ,I had to complete three tasks & create dashboard
1)     Call Centre Trend Analysis
2)     Customer Churn Analysis
3)     Diversity & Inclusion Analysis

Steps involved in creating the Dashboard
Step 1: Import Data
Step 2 : Transforming Data using Power Query Editor
Step 3 : Load Data
Step 4 : Performing DAX Calculations
Step 5 : Developing Interactive Dashboard
Thank you PwC & Forage for such a wonderful opportunity.
